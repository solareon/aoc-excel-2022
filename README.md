Excel is a still programming language. This repo archives my attempt to do all of the Advent of Code 2022 entirely in Excel without the use of VBA.

# Day 1
Sum until you hit a blank then write a 0 and repeat. Part one looks at MAX() over the range, Part 2 looks for the top 3 by using a shortcut and assuming that no single elf will have a maximum between two values of another elf. 

# Day 2
Remove the space to make typing the SWITCH() cases out easier and then build the truth tables for part 1 and part 2. Observant folks will see that each combination can only correspond to a single number between 1 to 9 with no repeats.
